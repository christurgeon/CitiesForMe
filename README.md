# CitiesForMe

### Overview

CitiesForMe is a web application that gives users suggestions on where to live based on what's important to them. For example, if a user is interested in places in the United States with warm weather and an active nightlife, but also a low cost of living, the app might recommend places like the suburbs around Miami or Fort Lauderdale as potential places to live. Recommendations are powered by crowdsourced data on top of baseline data collected from various sources.

### Features

- Take a quiz on what's important to you in an area you'd consider moving to
- After filling out the survey, explore city recommendations on a map
- View data on cities you've been recommended to see exactly why it's a good fit
- Explore properties that are for sale and for rent in recommended areas
-  Rate places you've lived before on various criteria, which will be considered when generating recommendations for other users

### Technologies

The application is built with Entity Framework on the backend, React on the frontend, and Postgres for the database. There's also some Python used to normalize datasets.
